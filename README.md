# relativity-integration-test-helpers
Open Source Community: Integration testing is a software testing methodology used to test individual software components or units of code to verify their interaction. These components are tested as a single group or organized in an iterative manner.That said, we have created Relativity Integration Test Helpers to assist you with writing good Integration Tests for your Relativity application. You can use this framework to test event handlers, agents or any workflow that combines agents and Eventhandlers. We will continue adding more helpers but in the mean time you should be able to create workspaces, create dbcontext, proxy and create documents with this framework. This framework is only compatible with Relativity 9.5
